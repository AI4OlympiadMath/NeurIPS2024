											<h2>Introduction</h2>
										</header>
										<p>AI for Olympiad Math is a recent research frontier and includes all
										  work leading to AI solving International Math Olympiad level problems.
										  <br>
										  We will have invited speakers, presentation of reviewed / accepted papers, and
										  considering this is such a new area, a panel of experts to allow for discussion and audience
										  participation. We will also organize a mini-competition for submitted systems before the
										  workshop and start the benchmarking site.</p>

									<li>
										<h3>Branislav Kisacanin, Nvidia</h3>
										<p>Branislav has organized 10+ workshops and tutorials at major conferences (CVPR, ECCV, â€¦). He has been the program chair of the Embedded Vision workshop at 2023 and 2024 CVPR. Most of his earlier contributions and patents are in automotive vision. Branislav has taught Olympiad math and physics at AwesomeMath since 2011. His current research interests are at the intersection of teaching competitive math and machine learning: AI for Olympiad math.
</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<h3>Titu Andreescu, AwesomeMath</h3>
										<p>Titu is a well-known coach of Romanian and US national teams for International Math Olympiads. His most notable success was when the US team he coached obtained a perfect score at the International Math Olympiad held in Hong Kong, the first and only time that any team had achieved this. More recently, he started AwesomeMath, considered to be one of the best schools for competitive math, with students from all around the world.
</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<h3>Boris Ginsburg, Nvidia</h3>
										<p>Boris is a Senior Director for Conversational AI at Nvidia. He has worked on the whole spectrum of Deep Learning problems: HW accelerators, frameworks, algorithms, applications. He was instrumental in building two Nvidia toolkits for NLP, speech recognition and for speech generation (OpenSeq2seq and Nemo), co-authored 24 papers in the domain of deep learning algorithms, speech recognition, and speech synthesis, and has 69 issued patents.
